## DESIGN
> This section should be organized in different subsections, each describing a different design problem that you had to solve during the project. Each subsection should be organized in four different parts:
#### Problem
>*problem description*d
#### KNOWN CODE SMELLS AND REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS
> This section should describe 3 to 5 different code smells that you have identified in your current implementation, and suggest ways in which the code could be refactored to eliminate them. Each smell and refactoring suggestions should be described in its own subsection.
